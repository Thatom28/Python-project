## Python project documentation
### Summary
Our project aims to make getting car insurance quotes quicker and easier. We want to reduce the number of people leaving the website due to long and complicated processes. Our goal is to provide users with a straightforward and hassle-free way to find out how much their car insurance might cost.
### Problem 
The problem I am trying to solve is to reduce the time it takes for a customer to get a quick quote for their insurance. Getting an insurance requires many documentations and authorisations. Therefore, wanted to save the client the time by auto implementing the calculation informally to give the customer an idea of how much their insurance might be without giving much information away.
